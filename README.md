I am creating a Javascript based Delhi Metro Network app by representing the whole network as a graph with train stations as vertices/nodes and train links as edges.
I am using D3.JS to visualize the graph and in future I plan to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm or another Pathfinding Algorithm to get the best route / best fare in the network and add more functionality like GPS and navigation with the visual graph
